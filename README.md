# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

For a larger project of interest, one of the components I sought out to try was sentiment analysis. As a first step, I found an open-source dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis/data) and stepped through one of the popular solutions (https://www.kaggle.com/code/payamamanat/bi-directional-lstm). 

The attached file is an edited version of the solutions with some comments and edits for me to better understand the procedure and framework.
